Instead now you can turn any weapon, armor or equipment into an Artifact.<br />There has also been some work to make the gear page behave more consistent when you have items with long names or use the PopOut! module.<br /><br /> As always, if you have comments, please visit the #free-league channel on the Foundry Discord or join #symbaroum-vtt-foundry on Davokar Explorers League Discord.  You can also see open features and bugs on our github page and are welcome to contribute. If you have comments, positive or negative feedback, please visit the #free-league channel on the Foundry Discord.
