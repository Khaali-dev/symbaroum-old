    </h1>


    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        This guide presents the main features of the Symbaroum system for Foundry VTT.
        <br>
        This system is unofficial, so there is no art or text from the rulebooks are included.
        It is assumed that the people using this system for Foundry VTT are in possession of the rulebooks.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h1>Creating Characters</h1>
    <p>
        To create a character, go to the Actor and click&nbsp;<em>Create Actor.</em>&nbsp;
        It will then prompt you for a name of the actor and what type it is, either&nbsp;<em>player<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>or&nbsp;<em>monster</em>.
        Once it has been selected, it shows a Character sheet where details of the character can be filled in.&nbsp;
        Items such as character name and race can be filled in, as well as the experience it has and how much of it that has been spent on re-rolls or binding to artifacts, how much has been spent on abilities and traits and finally how much is unspent.
        <br><br>
        Any field that has a blue-ish background can't be edited, this is because they are automatically calculated and the player do not need to change these fields. The portrait can be changed to a picture that the player likes.

    </p>
    &nbsp;<span class="img01">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <p>
        Underneath it has a set of tabs, main, gear, bio, etc. which can be used to supply the various information required.
        <br>
        On the main tab, the player can fill in their details of their attributes, how much toughness they have remaining and details of their corruption.
        <br>
        The corruption fields contains entries for how much Temporary (scene) corruption they've taken, any long term corruption, such as happens when consuming Krusan Berries, or even Permanent corruption they have accumulated.
        <br>
        The combat section allows for selection of the attribute that will be used for initiative or for defense.
        It also contains information of any worn armor or wielded weapons. See section about combat below.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Adding Abilities, Traits, Boons and Burdens</h2>
    <p>
        Please note that this System Module does not contain the details about these abilities, traits, boons and burdens and it is advised that the Game Master sets them up in advance.
        <br>
        There is a Compendium with the names of these in multiple languages that is recommended for use.
        <br><br>
        To add an ability, trait, boon or burden, the player drags them from the Item's selection to the Abilities &amp; Powers section of the character sheet.
        <br>

        &nbsp;<span class="img02">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        Once they are on the character sheet, the player can open it and see more information about it.
        For abilities and traits, no experience is deducted unless the player has ticked that they have learnt or aquired the ability or trait.
        For boons and burdens, it deducts experience as per the level, as detailed in APG.
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img03">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        The character sheet also shows a summary with a clickable icon, the name of the ability and what actions (Active, Passive, etc) the player can use with the ability or trait.
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img04">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h1>Weapons and Armor</h1>
    <p>
        Pre-configured weapons and armors are available in compendiums. We recommand you use them. Just find the compendiums corresponding to your langage in the compendium tab, and select "import".
        <br>
        To create an armor or weapon, select the tab&nbsp;<em>GEAR</em>&nbsp;on the character sheet.
        There is a&nbsp;<strong>+</strong>&nbsp;at the end of the tables for armor and weapons which when clicked, will create new armor or weapon and details about can be filled in.
        <br>
    </p>
    &nbsp;<span class="img05">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <p>
        Weapons have a class : One-handed (default), heavy, unarmed, short, long, ranged, thrown, and shield.
        <br>
        Attributes: The default base attribute is "Accurate" but you can select another one. You usually don't have to, since abilities that modify the attribute (Iron fist, Sixth sense...) will automaticaly do it.
        <br>
        There are two fields for the damage :
        <br>
        - Base damage : contains the damage dice of the weapon (1-handed is 1d8, short is 1d6…). You don't need to add passive bonuses from abilities, they will automaticaly added later.
        <br>
        - Bonus damage. This field should be left empty and be used only for exceptional situations, unsupported abilities and house rules.
        <br>
        - A weapon with the quality deep impact, or a wepon masterfully crafted to give it this quality have +1 damage, this damage should not be entered in the bonus field, just check the checkbox « deep impact » in the quality tab and the bonus will be added.

        The calculated damage is printed in the boxes under the weapon name : as in Symbaroum rules, PC damage is the damage roll formula when it’s a PC that wields it, and the NPC damage is the fixed damage used when it’s a NPC.
        <br>

        To add an armor or weapon to a character sheet, drag it them from the Item's selection to the armor or weapon section of the gear tab of the character sheet.
        Monsters with the "Natural weapon" trait should be given the weapon « Natural weapon » of the compendium, and those with the "Armored" trait should be given the "armored" Armor.
        <br>
        When a PC or NPC add a weapon or an armor, to its sheet, its damage or ptotection value is automaticaly recalculated, taking into account the character abilities and traits (man-at-arms, Robust, Iron Fist…). For weapons, the attribute is also evaluated, taking into account the class of the weapon.
        The weapon/arùor then appears on the character sheet with its final value printed. (dice value if it’s a PC sheet (ex: 1d8+1d6), fixed if it’s a monster sheet (ex: 7))
        <br>
        On the gear tab of the sheet, Weapons and armor have 3 states repredented bys a small icon, that you can change by clicking on it:
        <br>
        - stored (house icon): the item is stored out of immediate reach (in the character house, in a pack on a mule...)
        <br>
        - carried (briefcase icon): the item is sheated, or in a backpack
        <br>
        - active (shirt icon): the item is weared (armor) or in hand (weapon), and can be used for combat.
        <br>
        Active weapons, and the active armor, can be seen in the main tab of the character sheet. Click on them to make a roll (cf the combat section).
        Only one armor will be considered active at a time. If there is no active armor, the system will generate a "no armor" dummy armor, equipped by the character, with passive bonuses added (robust..).
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h1>Making an Attribute Test</h1>
    <p>
        Symbaroum often calls for a test to be performed against an attribute.
        The tests are often denoted within brackets and optionally, where it is a test versus someone else, it contain the attribute that is used as the difficulty of the roll.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Performing a Simple Attribute Test</h2>
    <p>To perform a an attribute test, the player clicks on the attribute that is used for the test, for example, if a test for discreet is called, the player clicks on the discreet attribute
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img06">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        This will then bring up the attribute test dialogue, see below.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Performing a Versus Attribute Test</h2>
    <p>If the test is to be performed against a token on the player field, then the player making the test, selects the token as a target.&nbsp;
        To select a target, right click on it and tick the "target icon".
        The&nbsp; selected target will then have arrows pointing at it, to show that it is now a target for the player.
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img07">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        Then the player clicks the attribute that the player wants to use.
        This then presents the attribute test dialogue to the player, where they can select the attribute that the token uses to resist the test.
        This will automatically then apply any bonus or penalty as normal to the test.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The Attribute Test Dialogue</h2>
    <p>
        The roll dialogue is dynamic and shows elements that are relevant for the test.
        In the majority of the attribute tests, there are three elements.
        The versus attribute, which is the attribute from the selected target token that is used to resist the attribute that the player is rolling.
        For example, a player has to make a&nbsp;<em>[Persuasive&larr;Resolute]</em>&nbsp;test against a token on the field.
        They've selected the token as the target and clicked their&nbsp;<em>Persuasive&nbsp;</em>attribute.
        In the dialogue, the selected is seen in the title of the window,&nbsp;<em>Persusasive</em>.
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img08">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        The player can then select the attribute the test is&nbsp; against, in the example above, it is the targets Resolute that is the versus attribute.
        The second field is if this is a normal test, or if the test is made with favour or disfavour.
        See an explanation for the terms Favour and Disfavour further down in this document.
    </p>
    The last field is any custom modifer that applies to this test, beyond the versus Attribute that was selected.
    It is important to note that if the versus Attribute is set to&nbsp;<em>Custom</em>&nbsp;then no attribute will be used and any penalties or bonuses will have to be entered in this field.
    <br>
    <br><br>
    <h1>Abilities, Powers and Traits</span></h1>


    &nbsp;<span class="img09">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;

    <p>
        All the Abilities, Mystical Powers and Traits are available in the system compendiums.
        In order to add one of them to a character or monster sheet, simply drag and drop it from the compendium to the sheet.
        Then you can indicated the levels know by this character by checking the "learned" box in the Novice, adept and master tab.
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img10">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        You can create your own abilities but in order to use the features of the system, you'll have to use the Abilities, powers and traits included in the compendiums.&nbsp;
        This system in unofficial, so we can't include the descriptions of those abilities.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h1>Using Powers</span></h1>
    <p>
        Powers can be activated by clicking on the orange dice of the item sheet.
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img11">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        Power activation is a WIP. <br>
        For now, only those active powers are supported: <br>
        anathema,&nbsp;brimstone cascade,&nbsp;bend will,&nbsp;curse,&nbsp;holy aura,&nbsp;inherit wound,&nbsp;larvae boils, lay on hands,&nbsp;unnoticeable
        <br>
        and the abilities:
        <br>
        acrobatics,&nbsp;dominate,&nbsp;leader,&nbsp;loremaster,&nbsp;medicus,&nbsp;witchsight.
        <br><br>
        When you activate a power, it will take in account the relevant abilities of the character and its target (leader ability, rapid reflexes, steadfast, traditions, impeding armour...).
        It will open a dialog window for the acting player asking a few questions:
        <br>

        &nbsp;<span class="img12">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>manual modifer (any other modifier to the roll...)</li>
        <li>favour / disfavour (see favour section of this guide)</li>
        <li>first casting or maintained. First casting is for the first round the player use the ability, and maintain is for the subsequent rounds (if relevant)</li>
    </ul>
    Most roll should be left by default. <br>
    Than the roll is made, and result is announced in the chat.
    <br>
    &nbsp;<span class="img14">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <br>
    If the result have effects on a token (damage, healing, corruption, stutus effects...) the gamemaster gets a chat entry with a button
    <br>
    &nbsp;<span class="img15">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <br>
    Clicking the button will automaticaly affect the results of the power to the tokens: damage will be substracted from toughness, temporary corruption added, etc.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h1>Combat</span></h1>
    <p>There are 2 options for combat:
        <br>
    <h2>Default Combat:</h2>

    <p>As with normal attribute rolls, combat works almost the same.
        The player has, based on its abilities and traits, selected which attribute is used for its initiative, defense and attack.
        The attack is set when you add a weapon to a character, as different weapons can use different attributes.
        <br>
    <h3><strong>Make an Attack</strong></h3>
    To make an attack with a weapon, the player clicks the weilded weapon on their character sheet under the main tab.
    <br>
    &nbsp;<span class="img16">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <br>
    It will then bring up the attribute test dialogue, where an attribute can be selected, or, which is more common in combat, the targets&nbsp;<em>defense</em>&nbsp;is selected.
    <br>
    &nbsp;<span class="img17">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <br>
    Beside the normal fields in the attribute test dialogue, the player can also choose to make this attack with&nbsp;<em>Advantage</em>&nbsp;as well as any damage bonuses beyond those bestowed by&nbsp;<em>Advantage</em>&nbsp;or the wearpon, for example&nbsp;<em>Backstab</em>.
    The result of the attack is then displayed in the chat window which then can be applied to the token on the battlefield.
    <br>
    &nbsp;<span class="img18">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <br>
    <h3><strong>Defend against an attack</strong></h3>
    To make a defense test against an attack, the player clicks on the equipped armor, which then opens the attribute test dialogue.
    This dialogue has a subtle difference that it also has a checkmark if the people attacking the player have&nbsp;<em>Advantage</em>, i.e. the player is at&nbsp;<em>Disadvantage</em>.
    <br>
    &nbsp;<span class="img19">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <br>
    If the defense is unsuccessful, then it will automatically roll the armor roll and display it in the chat window.
    <br>
    &nbsp;<span class="img20">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
    <br>
    In the example above, Abesina failed her defense test and her robes protects her for 2 points of damage.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Enhanced Combat:</h2>
    <p>
        Enhance combat can be activated by selecting the option in the system settings.<br><br>
        <strong>it is still a Work in Progress. Not every passive abilities have been integrated.</strong><br><br>
        Armor and weapons have to be equipped by the PCs and NPCs in order to be taken in account.<br>
        It automaticaly processes the attributes, traits&nbsp; and abilities of the attacker and its target, rolls the dice, evaluate damage.<br><br>
        The attribute used for attacking has to be defined on the weapon sheet. The defense attribute has to be selected on the character sheet. PCs and NPCs armors and weapons value have to be entered as 'dice' (for example a sword damage value would be 1d8 - the system will automaticaly transform this value to a fixed 4 when a NPC attacks a PC)
        <br><br>
        If a player character attacks a NPC, the player has to select its target, then click on a weapon to do the attack.
        If a NPC attacks a PC, the GM select the target, then clicks on the NPC weapon.
        <br><br>
        A dialog window will appear, asking which abilities of the attacker to use (iron fist, hunter's instinct...).
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img21">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        Then the attack roll is made, and if it's a hit, damage is roll. Result is printed in the chat
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img22">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        The gamemaster then gets a chat entry with a button
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img15">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;

        <br>
        Clicking the button will automaticaly affect the results of the attack to the tokens: damage will be substracted from toughness, status icons like poison and bleed added, etc.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h1>Initiative:</h1>
    The initiative used in the Symbaroum for FVTT system works the same way than stated in the rulebook, but in order to integrate in FVTT it uses the formula:
    <br>
    initiative = quick x 1000 + vigilant x 10 + 1d8.
    <br>
    This simple formula produces the same order than the rulebook, but the side effect is the strange big number that appear in the tracker.
    The 2 first digits are <i>Quick</i>, digits 3 and 4 are <i>Vigilant</i>, and the last digit is for randomize the rare event when both attributes are equal.
    So initiative 15106 means <i>Quick</i> 15, <i>Vigilant</i> 10, and the 6 is the random digit.
    It is possible to change the base attribute used for the formula in the character sheet (for characters with the <i>Tactician</i> abilty, for example).

    <h1>Favour/Disfavour:</h1>
    <p>
        The term&nbsp;<em>favour/disfavour</em>&nbsp;used in dialog boxes refers to situation when the acting character either rolls 2 dice and keeps the best (Hunter's instinct ability, steadfast resistance, ...) or in cases where disfavour (cursed, pariah, ...) is used, it keeps the worst.&nbsp;
        <br><br>

    <h1>Bonuses</h1>
    <p>
        All items can have different bonuses configurable. These can be used by the GM for various purposes, ranging from giving boosts or penalties to attributes, to increasing or decreasing toughness, changing corruption values.
        It can also be used to reduce the experience cost of something or even give a player experience without changing their total experience earned (only their unspent).
        When viewing any items, it will have a bonus section where an items behaviour can be changed.&nbsp;
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="img23">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br>
        It should be noted that Powers &amp; Abilities give bonuses as soon as they are on the character sheet.
        Bonuses on armor, weapons and items are only given when they are equipped.
        If an item gives a bonus, then it is listed in the tooltip for the thing it gives bonus.
        For example, a character with ability Exc Attribute Cunning, where their Cunning is 15 as standard, but, Symbaroum treats it as if was 16, because the bonus from the ability.
